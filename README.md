# Shayan's Macros
A hackpad to open my most frequented websites/applications.
Reciever.py needs to run on your system and detects the keypresses from the keyboard and it can complete tasks for you.
For me it opens:

- Gmail
- YouTube "My Mix" playlist
- Visual Studio Code
- Terminal

But, it'll take like two seconds to change it to any other website or app.

# Inspiration
I wanted fun buttons, but buttons that did things so I might actually use them.

## Challenges

I didn't have access to Fusion360, like the original tutorial, so it took me longer than it should've to figure out how to import the DXF with the keyholes into my design. Luckily, someone in the Slack helped me.


## BOM:

Same as the original but with 4 leds.

-    4x Cherry MX Switches
-    4x SK6812 MINI Leds
-    1x XIAO RP2040
-    4x Blank DSA Keycaps
-    4x M3x16 Bolt
-    4x M3 Heatset
-    1x Alps EC11E Vertical H20mm Rotary Encoder
